# Model United Nations Experience

## Biography
I am a dedicated individual with a deep passion for Model United Nations, which I actively pursue alongside my studies in Computer Science. My journey through MUN has been marked not only by participation but also by a commitment to fostering learning and growth among delegates. As a chair, my focus is always on creating an environment where delegates can maximize their learning potential. Every conference is an opportunity for me to guide and encourage participants to engage deeply with the issues at hand, thereby ensuring a fulfilling and educational experience for everyone involved.

Although my current busy schedule does not provide me the luxury of keeping up with all the latest global events in detail as much as I'd like to, I am still active in chairing conferences from time to time as well as helping out the MUN community by taking on teaching roles to help cultivate the next generation of MUNers in Taiwan.
